# TasteBuds
### Go to lunch with fresh faces

As companies grow, employees remain huddled within their immediate team and tend not to roam and collaborate with their cross-disciplinary teammates in other departments.

TasteBuds is a tool that comes into play during your lunch time.


Product Roadmap:  
✅ Gather tastebuds into, ideally, groups of 4 with a margin of error of ±1

✅ Tastebuds form an interdisciplinary group. In other words, they aren't grouped with teammates they ordinarily work with.

⬜️ Allow ability to add and remove teammates from company roster

⬜️ Only show user's own lunch group, with user in the center, and his or her tastebuds in a half circle bobbling around them—kind of in a "You matched with these people!" spirit.

* Requires building login/user management

⬜️ Hook up tastebud groupings to a lambda-cron function so it automatically notifies user of their proposed group a couple days before they go to lunch. Then remove the button to trigger grouping. This is ultimately pointless.

⬜️ Clicking/tapping on tastebud image brings up a tooltip of their social media profiles so you can get to know them a bit before going out to lunch.
